This is the official code repository of the DSTA Brainhack SeeTrue 2021 Hackathon!

The repository contains a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook which provides a sample implementation of deepfake detection via a [InceptionV3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567) model. The notebook serves as a quick start for the hackathon! You can choose to build upon this model or even better, build one entirely by yourself!

We strongly encouraged you to use [Google Colaboratory]("https://research.google.com/colaboratory/") for the hackathon! Google Colaboratory is an online browser-based platform that allows us to train our models on Google Cloud virtual machines(yes with GPUs!) for free! Check out this [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inN8seMm7UI) to get up to speed quickly with Google Colaboratory! 

To get started, open the notebook in Google Colaboratory:
